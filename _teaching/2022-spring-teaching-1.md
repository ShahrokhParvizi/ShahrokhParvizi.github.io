This is an introductory course on the standard model of particle physics. 

My approach is a theoretical point of view which is based on the Quantum Field Theory. Nonetheless, I try to deliver it independently while heavily relies on the Quantum Mechanics. Important items are the following: 

- Introduction
- Preliminaries
- Decay rates and cross sections
- Klien-Gordon and Dirac equations
- Interactions and Feynman diagrams
- The lowest order electromagnetic interactions
- The quark model and strong forces
- The weak interactions
- The electroweak unification
- Symmetry breaking and the Higgs model
