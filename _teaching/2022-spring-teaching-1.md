This is an introductory course on the standard model of particle physics. My approach is a theoretical point of view which is based on the Quantum Field Theory. Nonetheless, I try to deliver it independently while heavily relies on the Quantum Mechanics. Important items are the following: 
Chapter 1: Introduction
Chapter 2: Preliminaries
Chapter 3: Decay rates and cross sections
Chapter 4: Klien-Gordon and Dirac equations
Chapter 5: Interactions and Feynman diagrams
Chapter 6: The lowest order electromagnetic interactions
Chapter 7: The quark model and strong forces
Chapter 8: The weak interactions
Chapter 9: The electroweak unification
Chapter 10: Symmetry breaking and the Higgs model
